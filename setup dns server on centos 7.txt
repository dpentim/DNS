Setup hostname  

 

# hostnamectl set-hostname dns-master.peedee.auth 

 

Install the DNS(bind) packages 

 

# yum install bind bind-utils -y 

 

Go to /etc/named.conf and edit it 

 

# vim /etc/named.conf 

 

Look out for OPTION and edit your IP address as highlighted below: 

 

options { 

        listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1;35.184.57.249; }; 

        listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; }; 

        directory       "/var/named"; 

        dump-file       "/var/named/data/cache_dump.db"; 

        statistics-file "/var/named/data/named_stats.txt"; 

        memstatistics-file "/var/named/data/named_mem_stats.txt"; 

        recursing-file  "/var/named/data/named.recursing"; 

        secroots-file   "/var/named/data/named.secroots"; 

        allow-query     { localhost; Any; }; 

 

Start, enable and check the status of the service 

# systemctl start named 

# systemctl enable named 

# systemctl status named 

 

Open the port that DNS will listen. It listen on both TCP and UDP 

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/tcp 

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/udp 

# firewall-cmd --reload 

# firewall-cmd --list-all 

 

Go to /etc/named.conf again and configure  forward and reverse zones. Insert below syntax just two lines before the end of the file. 

 

zone "peedee.auth" IN { 

        type master; 

        file "forward.peedee.auth"; 

        allow-update { none; }; 

}; 

zone "57.184.35.in-addr.arpa" IN { 

        type master; 

        file "reverse.peedee.auth"; 

        allow-update { none; }; 

}; 

 

Now lets change directory to /var/named to create forward and reverse.conf  file 

#cd /var/named 

 *when you ls -l 

 

 

 

 

 

drwxrwx---. 2 named named   23 Nov 13 14:55 data 

drwxrwx---. 2 named named   60 Nov 13 14:56 dynamic 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  named 2253 Apr  5  2018 named.ca 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  named  152 Dec 15  2009 named.empty 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  named  152 Jun 21  2007 named.localhost 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  named  168 Dec 15  2009 named.loopback 

drwxrwx---. 2 named named    6 Oct 13 15:54 slaves 

You will see the following output. 

Copy named.localhost into …..foward.peedee.auth file and configure as shown below: 

#cp named.localhost forward.peedee.auth 

 

Now open the forwar.peedee.auth file and configure as shown below: 

#vim  forwar.peedee.auth 

 

$TTL 1D 

@       IN SOA  dns-master.peedee.auth. root.peedee.auth. ( 

                                        0       ; serial 

                                        1D      ; refresh 

                                        1H      ; retry 

                                        1W      ; expire 

                                        3H )    ; minimum 

@       IN      NS dns-master.peedee.auth 

@       IN      A  35.184.57.249 

dns-master IN   A  35.184.57.249 

host    IN      A  35.184.57.249 

free-ipa IN     A  35.222.138.146 

client  IN      A  35.222.138.146 

 

Save and quit 

 

Now that we have created forward.peedee.auth we can copy the file into reverse.peedee.auth to configure it as well. 

# cp forward.peedee.auth reverse.peedee.auth 

 

Now open reverse.peedee.auth and configure as shown below; 

# vim reverse.peedee.auth 

 

$TTL 1D 

@       IN SOA  dns-master.peedee.auth. root.peedee.auth. ( 

                                        0       ; serial 

                                        1D      ; refresh 

                                        1H      ; retry 

                                        1W      ; expire 

                                        3H )    ; minimum 

@       IN      NS dns-master.peedee.auth. 

@       IN      PTR peedee.auth. 

dns-master IN   A  35.184.57.249 

host    IN      A  35.184.57.249 

free-ipa IN     A  35.222.138.146 

client  IN      A  35.222.138.146 

249     IN      PTR     dns-server.peedee.auth. 

146     IN      PTR     free-ipa.peedee.auth. 

 

 

Now when you do ls -l, you will find out that the file and group is own by root but we want the group to be owned by named, so we change ownership to named. 

 

drwxrwx---. 2 named named   23 Nov 13 14:55 data 

drwxrwx---. 2 named named   60 Nov 13 14:56 dynamic 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  root   325 Nov 13 16:20 forward.peedee.auth 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  named 2253 Apr  5  2018 named.ca 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  named  152 Dec 15  2009 named.empty 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  named  152 Jun 21  2007 named.localhost 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  named  168 Dec 15  2009 named.loopback 

-rw-r-----. 1 root  root   394 Nov 13 16:25 reverse.peedee.auth 

 

 

# chown root:named forward.peedee.auth  

# chown root:named reverse.peedee.auth  

 

Now lets use below command to check if our configuration is good 

# named-checkconf -z /etc/named.conf 

 

When it shows the following output, it measn the configuration is ok 

 

 

zone peedee.auth/IN: loaded serial 0 

zone 57.184.35.in-addr.arpa/IN: loaded serial 0 

zone localhost.localdomain/IN: loaded serial 0 

zone localhost/IN: loaded serial 0 

zone 1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.ip6.arpa/IN: loaded serial 0 

zone 1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa/IN: loaded serial 0 

zone 0.in-addr.arpa/IN: loaded serial 0 

OK 

 

We can also check the zones configurations if the are good too: 

# named-checkconf -z /etc/named.conf 

 

#named-checkzone forward /var/named/forward.peedee.auth  

zone forward/IN: loaded serial 0 

OK 

 

#named-checkzone reverse /var/named/reverse.peedee.auth 

zone reverse/IN: loaded serial 0 

OK 

 So above checks shown that all our configurations are ok. 

Now we can restart 

#systemctl restart named  

If it started without an error means our DNS server configuration is good. 

 

 

NOW LET US MOVE TO THE CLIENTS SITE 

 

Setup host name 

# hostnamectl set-hostname free-ipa.peedee.auth 

 

Open /etc/resolve.conf 

#vim /etc/resolve.conf
